## Required browser certification

1. Complete a single-player run on a non-default map and difficulty.
2. Confirm **LOCAL SCORE SAVED** appears and the Local Leaderboard opens to that category.
3. Confirm **ONLINE SCORE ACCEPTED** or **ONLINE SCORE QUEUED** appears.
4. Open Career & Achievements and verify level, XP, career totals, locked achievements, and completed achievements.
5. Confirm Settings shows the simplified Cloud Save row by default.
6. Open and close Manage Cloud Account.
7. On a connected guest account, click Sign In using its own account ID and confirm the game instructs the player to upgrade first.
8. Upgrade the guest account using a passkey on the HTTPS Pages deployment.
9. Sign out and sign in again.
10. Verify the frontend and Worker release manifests match.

## Deferred roadmap

- M5 early: co-op quick messages and text chat.
- Later M5: evaluate push-to-talk voice chat with mute, device selection, permissions, and safety controls.
- CrazyGames and other web portal publishing remains after game stability and certification.
- Android APK/native mobile packaging is a post-web-release phase. It should replace the mobile-browser presentation only after single-player, multiplayer, portal publishing, and web release stabilization are complete.
